# Vacation Tracking System
- The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) is designed to empower individual employees by enabling them to efficiently manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without requiring an in-depth understanding of company policies or local facility-specific leave regulations. This concept is introduced in the book [Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, Third Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/object-oriented-analysis-and/9780201895513/)
