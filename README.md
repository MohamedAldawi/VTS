# Vacation Tracking System
- The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) is designed to empower individual employees by enabling them to efficiently manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, without requiring an in-depth understanding of company policies or local facility-specific leave regulations. This concept is introduced in the book [Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, Third Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/object-oriented-analysis-and/9780201895513/)
- I crafted the system's workflow and providing a comprehensive definition of its use cases, which included the creation of detailed Flow, State, and ERD diagrams.

# System Overview  
  This system holds the promise of significant time and cost savings, primarily within the HR department. It essentially removes the manual, individual time request process and replaces it with a rule-based   validation system. HR personnel will retain their responsibilities for inputting and updating employee vacation data in the system, but they will no longer serve as intermediaries in the request and       
  validation process for each individual time request.

# System Features
1. A rule-based system for the validation and verification of leave time requests.
2. Grant access to requests from the previous calendar year and permit requests to be made up to a year and a half in advance.
3. Email notifications to request manager approval and inform employees of changes in request status.
4. Enable HR and system administration personnel to override actions restricted by rules, with logging of those overrides.
5. Empower managers to directly allocate personal leave time within system-defined limits.
